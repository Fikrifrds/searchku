2. **Search and Discovery**: User enters search query → system generates query embedding → performs semantic similarity search → returns ranked results with snippets

3. **Translation Workflow**: User selects a page → views original text → adds/edits English or Indonesian translations → saves changes with version tracking

4. **Book Management**: User browses book library → selects book for detailed view → manages pages and translations → monitors translation progress
